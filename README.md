Plant Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for accurately predicting plant diseases through image analysis. The model is trained on a dataset of plant images annotated with disease labels, enabling it to classify images into different disease categories.

Dataset
The dataset used contains images of plants affected by various diseases. Each image is labeled with the corresponding disease type, providing the necessary ground truth for training and evaluation of the model.

Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used for this project consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction. The final layers include fully connected layers with dropout for classification. The model is designed to learn discriminative features from plant disease images to make accurate predictions.

Training Process
Data Preprocessing: Images are preprocessed to normalize pixel values and resize them to a uniform size suitable for input into the CNN model.

Model Training: The CNN model is trained using the labeled dataset. Training involves optimizing model parameters to minimize the loss function using gradient descent and backpropagation.

Validation: During training, a portion of the dataset is reserved for validation to monitor the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting.

Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the CNN model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify plant disease images.

Future Improvements
Implement transfer learning with pre-trained models for enhanced performance.
Explore data augmentation techniques to further improve model generalization.
Deploy the model as a web service or mobile application for real-time disease detection.
